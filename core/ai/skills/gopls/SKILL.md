# Project Instructions for AI Code Assistant with gopls-mcp

When reading this file please explicitly mention that you did.

## Context

You are an AI programming assistant helping users with Go code. You have access to gopls-mcp tools
for semantic code analysis.

## CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS (NEVER DO THIS)

1. NEVER use `go_search` for text content (comments, strings, TODOs). Use `Grep` tool.
2. NEVER use grep/ripgrep for symbol discovery (definitions, references, implementations).
3. NEVER fall back from exclusive capabilities (see Tool Selection Guide).

<!-- Marker: AUTO-GEN-START -->

## Tool Selection Guide

### Code relationships (Exclusive Capabilities - NO FALLBACK)

| Task                           | Tool                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Find interface implementations | go_implementation       |
| Trace call relationships       | go_get_call_hierarchy   |
| Find symbol references         | go_symbol_references    |
| Jump to definition             | go_definition           |
| Analyze dependencies           | go_get_dependency_graph |
| Preview renaming               | go_dryrun_rename_symbol |

### Code exploration (Enhanced Capabilities - FALLBACK ALLOWED)

| Task                   | Tool                         | Fallback after 3 failures |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| List package symbols   | go_list_package_symbols      | Glob + Read               |
| List module packages   | go_list_module_packages      | find                      |
| Analyze workspace      | go_analyze_workspace         | Manual exploration        |
| Quick project overview | go_get_started               | Read README + go.mod      |
| Search symbols by name | go_search                    | grep + Read               |
| Check compilation      | go_build_check               | go build                  |
| Get symbol details     | go_get_package_symbol_detail | Read                      |
| List modules           | go_list_modules              | Read go.mod               |

## Integration Workflow

1. **Classify task type**: Route to Exclusive capabilities, Enhanced capabilities, or Grep tool
   based on the Tool Selection Guide.
2. **Validate**: Check intent against "Tool-Specific Parameters & Constraints" BEFORE execution.
3. **Construct & Execute**: Extract exact symbol names and file paths, execute the tool.
4. **Format Output**: Present file:line locations, signatures, and documentation cleanly. Do not
   dump raw JSON.

## Tool-Specific Parameters & Constraints

- **go_search**:
  - FATAL: `query` MUST NOT contain spaces or semantic descriptions.
  - Must be symbol names only (single token). Correct: `query="ParseInt"`.
  - Does NOT search comments or documentation.
- **go_implementation**:
  - Only for interfaces and types. STRICTLY PROHIBITED for functions.
- **go_get_package_symbol_detail**:
  - `symbol_filters` format: `[{name: "Start", receiver: "*Server"}]`.
  - `receiver` requires exact string match (`"*Server"` != `"Server"`).
- **General Parameters**:
  - `symbol_name`: Do not include package prefix (Use `"Start"`, not `"Server.Start"`).
  - `context_file`: Obtain strictly from the current file being analyzed.

## Error Handling & Retry (Self-Correction)

- Check if parameters strictly follow the constraints above.
- Try a shorter/simpler symbol name.
- Re-analyze code context before retrying.

## Fallback Conditions (For Enhanced Capabilities ONLY)

Trigger fallback manually IF AND ONLY IF:

1. 3 consecutive tool failures.
2. Timeout exceeds 30 seconds.
3. Empty result returned when code existence is absolutely certain. _Note: Retry gopls-mcp tool
   first on the very next user query even after a previous fallback._
